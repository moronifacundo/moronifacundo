# 💫 About Me :

👋 Hi, I’m @moronifacundo

👀 I’m interested in many many things! I am a Full Stack Developer, I love languages, I studied Industrial Engineering, and I design games for fun. I also enjoy teaching, and I am a Teacher of English as a Foreign Language.

💻 I have worked mostly with TS, JS, NodeJS, Python, React, Redux, Express, Postgres, Remix Run, Prisma.

🌱 I’m currently (and always) deepening my knowledge. These days, UX/UI and Web Developing in general.

💞️ Along with two good friends/partners, I co-founded PPrina Software Factory, where I also work as a Fullstack/FrontEnd Developer.
